# Primary Analysis

From SAP: "Incident TB: We will compare incident TB using a Poisson model with a log(offset) term to account for the time at risk and estimate the relative difference in rates using incidence rate ratios."

```{r}
pois <- readRDS("../results/incidenceTB/tbl_pois.rds")
pois
```

### Plots supplementing the primary analysis

We did not mention these plots/comparisons in the SAP.

# Secondary analysis 1

From SAP: "Logistic regression in order to estimate risk factors for TB."

#### Switzerland

```{r}
log.ch <- readRDS("../results/incidenceTB/tbl_log_ch.rds")
log.ch
```

#### South Africa

```{r}
log.rsa <- readRDS("../results/incidenceTB/tbl_log_rsa.rds")

# Secondary analysis 2

From SAP: "Kaplan-Meier estimate for the survival probability accounting for competing risk (death), will be used to describe the time to incident TB over time"
